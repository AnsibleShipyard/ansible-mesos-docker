Mesos-Docker Playbook for Ansible

Support open source!

NOTE: This role requires the following roles:
  - ansible-docker
  - ansible-marathon

I've supplied thee to galaxy and you should be able to pull them or clone them
directly from github. I'm not a fan of specifying a dependency without a
version, thus I've removed them from `meta/main.yml`.

## How to use this playbook?

See this sample [playbook](https://github.com/AnsibleShipyard/ansible-galaxy-roles/blob/master/playbook.yml)
which shows how to use this playbook as well as others. It is part of [ansible-galaxy-roles](https://github.com/AnsibleShipyard/ansible-galaxy-roles) and
serves as a curation (and thus an example) of all our ansible playbooks.
