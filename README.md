====================

Mesos-Docker Playbook for Ansible

Support open source!

NOTE: This role requires the following roles:
  - ansible-docker
  - ansible-marathon

I've supplied thee to galaxy and you should be able to pull them or clone them
directly from github. I'm not a fan of specifying a dependency without a
version, thus I've removed them from `meta/main.yml`.
